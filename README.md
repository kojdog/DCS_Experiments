# Test 1: APR-25 & APR-26 RHAW Equipment
First project is likely to be elements of the APR-25 and APR-26 RHAW gear.
As a non-SDK/licensed project, the RHAW will depend on exposed RWR functionality from the LockOn libraries.
See this tremendously helpful resource on a later model APR-25:

The Community A-4E provides a reasonable test-bed for non-display functionality (although some TDU functions can be tried with existing lights).
